**GDSC Website**
This project was built as part of the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) initiative, based on the Figma design provided by our college. The goal was to create a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-->Overview
The project is housed in the gdsc folder of this repository. It includes a multi-page website developed to closely follow the design specifications provided in the Figma file. The primary focus was on replicating the layout, styling, and overall user experience.

The website was built without using frameworks such as React to focus on raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I faced some challenges with responsiveness and performance-related animations, which are discussed below.

-->Challenges Faced
1)Responsiveness:
The layout proved to be challenging across different screen sizes.
I addressed most issues but acknowledged that further work is needed for full responsiveness across all devices.
Locomotive.js:
I attempted to integrate Locomotive.js to achieve smoother scrolling animations.
Without React, I encountered issues during integration, which prevented full implementation in the time available.
2)Time Constraints:
Given the deadline, some features were not as polished as I had hoped, but I focused on ensuring that the design was as close to the provided Figma as possible.
-->Technologies Used
HTML5: For the website's structure.
CSS3: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: To handle interactivity and dynamic elements.
Locomotive.js (attempted): For smooth scrolling and animations (to be revisited in future iterations).
-->Future Improvements
Complete Responsiveness:

While the site works on many devices, I plan to improve and test responsiveness on smaller screens and mobile devices.
Locomotive.js Integration:

I intend to refactor the project, potentially using React, to successfully integrate Locomotive.js and achieve smoother scrolling animations.
Performance Optimization:

Future work will focus on improving JavaScript and CSS performance for faster load times and smoother interactions.
